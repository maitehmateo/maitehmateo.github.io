<blockquote align="center">An estimated 325,000 migrants from 13 TPS-designated countries
resided in the United States </blockquote>

<p>Department of Homeland Security announced that has decided to terminate the TPS, Temporary Protected Status for Honduras and Nicaragua with a 12-month delay. DHS also said that has not been able to reach a decision on Honduras. At the end of that six-month window, the homeland security secretary will make a decision to terminate or further extend the status.</p>
</p>


<p>The US government granted the TPS to Honduras and Nicaragua after the devastating hurricane Mitch in 1999 and in 2010 for Haiti after the 7.0 earthquake.
Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, is not ready to take back 55,000 immigrants as the country continues to face political and security uncertainty.
