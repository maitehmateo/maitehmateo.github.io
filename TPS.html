<blockquote align="center">An estimated 325,000 migrants from 13 TPS-designated countries
resided in the United States </blockquote>

<p>On Monday November 06, the Department of Homeland Security announced that has decided to terminate the TPS, Temporary Protected Status for Nicaragua with a 12-month delay. DHS also said that has not been able to reach a decision on Honduras. At the end of that six-month window, the homeland security secretary will make a decision to terminate or further extend the status.</p>
</p>


<p>The US government granted the TPS to Honduras and Nicaragua after the devastating hurricane Mitch in 1999. On November 6, in a statement issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Eliane Duke, announced the decision to end the TPS for 5,600 Nicaraguans , alleging that Daniel Ortega's government did not formally request the need for an extension. He also confirmed the postponement of his decision on 57,600 Hondurans to whom they provide a six-month extension.</p>
